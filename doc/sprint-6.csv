Epic,Implement Basic RAG,,,Integrate Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to allow the chatbot to access and use external information.,Sprint 6,Chat Application,RAG,,1
User Story,,Retrieve Relevant Information,,"As a user, I want the chatbot to be able to retrieve relevant information from external sources so that it can provide more comprehensive and informative responses.",Sprint 6,Chat Application,RAG;Information Retrieval,"The chatbot can retrieve relevant information from designated external sources based on user queries.",2
Task,,,Set up a vector database,"Set up a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS) to store and retrieve information.",Sprint 6,Chat Application,RAG;Vector Database,"Vector database set up and configured correctly.",3
Task,,,Populate the vector database with initial data,"Populate the vector database with initial data relevant to the chatbot's domain.",Sprint 6,Chat Application,RAG;Data Ingestion,"Vector database populated with relevant data.",3
Task,,,Implement retrieval logic,"Implement the logic to query the vector database and retrieve relevant information based on user input.",Sprint 6,Chat Application,RAG;Search,"Retrieval logic implemented and tested.",3
User Story,,Integrate Retrieved Information into Chat Responses,,"As a user, I want the chatbot to seamlessly integrate the retrieved information into its responses so that the information is presented naturally within the conversation.",Sprint 6,Chat Application,RAG;Response Generation,"Retrieved information is integrated smoothly and contextually into the chatbot's responses.",2
Task,,,Modify LLM prompts to include retrieved information,"Modify the prompts sent to the LLM to include the retrieved information.",Sprint 6,Chat Application,RAG;LLM Integration,"LLM prompts modified to incorporate retrieved information.",3
Task,,,Format retrieved information for display in chat,"Format the retrieved information (e.g., with citations) for clear and understandable display in the chat interface.",Sprint 6,Chat Application,RAG;Formatting;UI,"Retrieved information is formatted appropriately for display in the chat.",3
User Story,,Handle Cases Where No Relevant Information is Found,,"As a user, I want the chatbot to handle cases where no relevant information is found gracefully so that the conversation doesn't abruptly end or provide misleading information.",Sprint 6,Chat Application,RAG;Error Handling,"The chatbot provides a suitable response when no relevant information is found.",2
Task,,,Implement logic to handle empty retrieval results,"Implement logic to handle cases where the vector database returns no results.",Sprint 6,Chat Application,RAG;Error Handling;Empty Results,"Chatbot handles empty retrieval results gracefully and provides an appropriate message to the user.",3
Task,,,Test RAG integration,"Thoroughly test the RAG integration to ensure it functions as expected in various scenarios.",Sprint 6,Chat Application,RAG;Testing,"RAG integration tested thoroughly, including edge cases and error handling.",3
