# Delivery Plan for OpenAI Chat Clone

This plan outlines the key features and timelines for developing the OpenAI Chat clone. It assumes an iterative, agile approach with sprints of approximately 2 weeks (adjust as needed).

## Phase 1: Foundation (MVP - ~4 sprints)

* **Sprint 1: Basic Chat and Authentication**
  * Focus: Core chat functionality, user authentication, basic API.
  * Deliverables: Functional single chat, user registration/login/logout, API endpoints for messaging.
* **Sprint 2: Enhanced Chat UI and User Management**
  * Focus: Improved React.js UI, user profiles, basic notification system.
  * Deliverables: Visually appealing chat interface, user profile management, optional notifications for new messages.
* **Sprint 3: Group Chat**
  * Focus: Implementing group chat functionality.
  * Deliverables: Users can create and join groups, send messages to groups.
* **Sprint 4: API Refinement and Documentation**
  * Focus: Finalizing API, comprehensive documentation.
  * Deliverables: Well-documented and robust API ready for external use.

## Phase 2: Core Features (~4 sprints)

* **Sprint 5: Role-Playing LLM**
  * Focus: Implement basic role-playing functionality.
  * Deliverables: Users can select different roles for the LLM.
* **Sprint 6: Basic RAG Implementation**
  * Focus: Integrate basic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
  * Deliverables: Chatbot can access and use external information sources.
* **Sprint 7: Enhanced NLP Features**
  * Focus: Integrate additional NLP features (e.g., sentiment analysis).
  * Deliverables: Chatbot can understand and respond to user sentiment.
* **Sprint 8: Basic Agent Framework**
  * Focus: Implement a basic agent framework.
  * Deliverables: A simple agent can perform a predefined task.

## Phase 3: Refinement and Scaling (Ongoing)

* **Sprint 9 onwards:**
  * Focus: Refinement, performance, scaling, advanced agents.
  * Deliverables: Continuously improved performance, scalability, and more sophisticated agent interactions.

## Dependencies

* Phase 2 depends on the completion of Phase 1.
* Phase 3 depends on the completion of Phase 2.

## Key Considerations

* **Sprint Length:**  Approximately 2 weeks (adjust as needed).
* **Team Velocity:**  Estimate realistically.
* **Flexibility:**  Be prepared to adapt the plan as the project progresses.
